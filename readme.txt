Analysis of Code Evolution (ACE)

ACE is a software tool to manually annotate different stages
(e.g. commits in a version control system) of evolution of a software
code repository. Abhishek Dutta (https://abhishekdutta.org) initiated
the development of ACE because he wanted to manually annotate the
different stages of evolution of the source code of word count tool
(i.e. wc) in GNU Coreutils. Such manual annotation, it was hoped,
provide a glimpse into how a software evolves of time. The development
of ACE started on 2023-Sep-23.
